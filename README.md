# 👋 Hi, I'm Kavinder Roghit Kanthen!  

### 🚀 Machine Learning Engineer | AI Researcher | Scalable AI Solutions  

I started my journey thinking I'd use a **stethoscope**, but I found my true calling in **diagnosing data** instead of patients. Now, I build **AI solutions that matter**—from **medical imaging** to **embedded AI and scalable machine learning systems**.  

## 🔹 What I Do  
- **AI for Impact** 🏥🔬 – Developed ML models for **healthcare, audio AI, and reinforcement learning**  
- **Scalable AI Systems** 🌍🚀 – Deploying AI with **Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, and AWS**  
- **Model Optimization & Hardware AI** ⚡🔧 – Accelerating AI inference with **TensorRT, OpenVINO, and Edge TPU**  

## 🎯 Passion & Focus  
I love taking AI from **research to production**, making it **scalable, efficient, and real-world ready**. Whether optimizing deep learning models, deploying AI in the cloud, or integrating ML into edge devices—I thrive on solving complex challenges.  

## 📢 Looking for Machine Learning Engineer Roles!  
I'm actively seeking opportunities to **design, optimize, and deploy AI solutions at scale**.
